The location is great, walking distance from a grocery store, pharmacy and a good pizza place. It's about 15-20 minutes from the airport and about 30 minutes from the V & A Water Front. The neighborhood is intimate, we walked around everyday and enjoyed it. The apartment is spacious and as advertised. We would gladly stay here again given the location and peacefulness of the neighborhood. This was our first Air BnB experience so we were a little nervous, but we are really glad that were fortunate enough to start out with this one.\",\n          \"You have a direct  view fromthe accomadation of the sea.
